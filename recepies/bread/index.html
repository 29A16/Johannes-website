<ul>
<li>100 g sourdough (20%)</li>
<li>10 g salt</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Let the dough ferment in a closed container with regular (every ~2h) coil folding to build dough strength, until the dough reaches desired consistency and bubbles are present.
Transfer dough into a flowered proofing basket and let it prove for 2h.
Transfer into a preheated oven with a preheated baking form of 200°C for 20 min. Bake for 20 min covered and 20 min without cover.</p>
<h2 id="flat-bread---yeast">Flat bread - Yeast</h2>
<ul>
<li>180 ml warm water</li>
<li>1 tsp dry yeast</li>

<ul>
<li>300 g flower</li>
<li>1 tsp salt</li>
<li>1 tsp olive oil</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Mix with water and kneed. Let the dough rest until it doubles in size.
Separate the dough into four peaces and form spheres. Cover and let sit for 15 min.
Roll out the dough and heat in frying pan (without oil) - optimally the bread puffs up.

<ul>
<li>100 g (white cheddar) cheese</li>
<li>olive oil</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Grade the cheese.
Divide the dough into 4 peace and role it out into a rectangle - as thin as possible. Bruch the rectangle with olive oil and cut into 4 stripes.
Add the cheese onto each of the stripes and roll them up into cylinder. Place in the fridge for 15 min.
Roll the cylinder (flat side facing upwards) and heat in frying pan (without oil).

<h2 id="brioche">Brioche</h2>
<ul>
<li>100 g of milk</li>
<li>3 eggs or 150g (fill up remainder with milk)</li>
<li>40 g sugar</li>
<li>10 g of salt</li>
<li>150 g of active sourdough</li>
<li>450 g flower</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Mix milk, eggs, sugar and salt together before adding the active sourdough. Start Adding the flower and mix until no dry flower is left and it holds together.
Knead for 10 min.</p>
<ul>
<li>100 g of butter</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Take half of the softened butter and kneed into the dough - fold the dough into itself until the dough comes apart from the layer of butter.
Keep kneading for 10 min or until no more butter sticks to the counter surface (Use bench scraper to take up butter and dough sticking to the surface).
Let the dough sit for 20 min and repeat with the rest of the butter.
Shape into a ball and let the dough rest for 5 min.
(Optional windowpane test - check if light can pass through the stretched do without the dough ripping. If test failed knead for another 5 min.)
Transfer the dough ball into a greased and covered fermenting bool.
Let the dough ferment for 5-10 h.</p>
<hr>
<p>After the fermentation step the dough can be placed into the fridge for up to 24 h.</p>
<hr>
<p>Divide the dough into 6 even ball pieces and put into pan / bake as rolls or buns (Shaping is easier when dough is chilled).
Cover the container and let the dough proof for 6-8 h or until doubled in size.</p>
<hr>
<p>Optionally - add egg wash to the top of the bread / roll.
Bake for 30-40 min at 180 °C
